# 🚗 Customer Car Price Estimator App

This is a simple Streamlit web application that predicts an estimated car price for a customer based on their **age**, **salary**, and **net worth**. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to assist car dealerships or advisors in suggesting a suitable car price range for potential buyers.

## 📌 Features

- 🔢 User inputs: Age, Salary, and Net Worth  
- 🔍 Model predicts an estimated car price  
- 🎈 Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**  
- ⚙️ ML model and scaler loaded with **joblib**

## 🚀 About the App

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can be used to support decision-making in a real-world business scenario—car pricing suggestions based on customer profiles.

**How it works:**

1. User inputs customer details (age, salary, net worth)
2. Inputs are scaled using a pre-trained `scaler.pkl`
3. A machine learning model (`model.pkl`) predicts the estimated price
4. The result is displayed on the page with a friendly message
